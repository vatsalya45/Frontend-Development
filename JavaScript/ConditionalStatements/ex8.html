<!--
1. Problem Statement:
Write a 'JavaScript' program that takes a month number (1-12) as input from the user and prints the number of days in that month using a switch statement. 
If the user enters a number outside the range of 1-12, the program should display an error message.

2. Explanation:
You need to use a switch statement to handle different cases for each month.
For months with 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, December), display "31 days".
For months with 30 days (April, June, September, November), display "30 days".
For February (month 2), print "28 or 29 days (depending on leap year)" as February can have 28 or 29 days.
For any invalid month number (not between 1 and 12), print "Invalid month number!".

3. Additional Considerations:
The program should handle user input and validate it using a switch-case structure.
No need for a leap year calculation in this basic program, but mention that leap years affect Februaryâ€™s day count.


Sample input_1  : 3
Sample output_1 : 31 days

Sample input_2  : 2
Sample output_2 : 28 or 29 days (depending on leap year)

Sample input_3  : 11
Sample output_3 : 30 days
