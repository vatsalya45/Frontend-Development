		At Patna's Gardanibagh, the aspirants demanded that Kishor step away, accusing him of being absent when police used water cannons and batons against them.

		Upon his arrival, Kishor was met with chants of “Prashant Kishor, go back,” leading to a heated argument with student leaders. The situation escalated when he remarked, “You take blankets from us and then show us attitude,” as reported by India Today.</p>
